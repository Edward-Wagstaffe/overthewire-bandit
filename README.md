# OverTheWire Bandit Writeups

This repository contains my writeups for the OverTheWire Bandit wargame.  
Bandit is a beginner-friendly CTF designed to teach practical Linux skills, remote server access, and basic problem-solving techniques in a hands-on environment.

As a cybersecurity student, this marks the start of my CTF journey and my effort to build foundational skills. Through these challenges, I am learning to:

- Navigate the Linux command line efficiently
- Connect to and explore remote servers via SSH
- Handle files, directories, and hidden content
- Understand special characters and paths
- Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving and flag collection

Each level includes concise steps, commands, and notes reflecting what I learned along the way.
